/**
 * 1. Write an application to perform basic arithmetic operations like add, subtract, multiply & divide. You need to define a functional interface first.

Description:-

Define Functional Interface and write a program to perform arithmetic operations like add, subtract, multiply and divide using functional interface.

Examples:

              Input:-          13       5

              Output:-

                                      18.0      //Addition of 13 and 5

                                       8.0        //Subtraction of 13 and 5

                                       65.0      // Multiplication of 13 and 5  

                                       2.6        //Division of 13 and 5

FunctionalInterface:-

A functional interface is an interface that contains only one abstract method. They can have only one functionality to exhibit. From Java 8 onwards, lambda expressions can be used to represent the instance of a functional interface. A functional interface can have any number of default methods. Runnable, ActionListener, Comparable are some of the examples of functional interfaces.
