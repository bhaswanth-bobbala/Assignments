Specifications:

class Manager extends Assignment2Q2 {
    @Override
    public int getSalary(int salary) {
        int incentive = 5000;
    }
}

class Labour extends Assignment2Q2 {
    @Override
    public int getSalary(int salary) {
        int overtime = 500;
    }
}

public class Assignment2Q2 {
    int salary = 10000;
    public int getSalary(int salary){}
    public int totalEmployeesSalary(ArrayList<Integer> employeeSalaries){}
    public static void main(String[] args) {}
}

        int incentive = 5000;

    }

class Labour extends Assignment2Q2 {
    @Override
    public int getSalary(int salary) {
        int overtime = 500;

		return 0;
    	
    }
    public static int totalEmployeesSalary(ArrayList<Integer> employeeSalaries){
    	for (i=0;i<=employeeSalaries.size()-1;i++) {
