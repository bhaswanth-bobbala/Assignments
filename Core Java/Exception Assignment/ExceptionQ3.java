/**
 * Write an application to perform withdraw functionality on a SavingAccount object. Point to
note:
	a. Raise InsufficientBalanceException if you are trying to withdraw more than balance
	   or when you balance is zero. E.g. if you balance is 2000 and if you are trying to
	   withdraw 2100 or if you balance is 0 and you are trying to withdraw positive value.
	b. Raise IllegalBankTransactionException if you are trying to withdraw a negative value
	   from your balance. E.g. if you try to withdraw a negative value savingAcc.withdraw(-
       1000);
Note: SavingAccount
